Task 2 – Titanic Survival Analysis
# Prodigy InfoTech Internship (Data Science)
Introduction: -
This task involves analyzing the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand which factors influenced passenger survival. By using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the data is cleaned, visualized, and studied to identify survival patterns based on gender, age, passenger class, and boarding port. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from real historical data through effective EDA techniques.
Dataset: -
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status. This dataset is widely used for educational purposes and provides an opportunity to explore various data analysis techniques.
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle: -
The dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns.
The columns are as follow:
PassengerId : Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Binary variable indicating survival(1 as Survived, 0 as not Survive).
Pclass: Ticket class(1st, 2nd,3rd class).
Name:Passenger’s name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
Sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parants/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation
